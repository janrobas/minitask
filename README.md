## About

**minitask** is a simple desktop application for managing tasks. The application essentially implements a simple form of a Kanban board (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board>). Each task is in one of the 4 states, which are represented by the columns on the board (backlog, todo, wip, done). We can change the state of a task simply by dragging it. The user interface is designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible.

The application is created using front-end web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) and Electron.

## Motivation

This project was made for my personal use, because I usually keep my personal tasks in a messy text file, roughly categorized by the 4 states mentioned before. I wanted to have a simple desktop application to manage those tasks and I wanted to be able to save my tasks into files, so I can put them on the personal cloud.
